# Next steps

1. Add routing:
   I wanted this to build as simple as a single page so I didn't use routing. But given the functionality, we can add routing and if the user is registered successfully we can redirect them to dashboard/home screen or login screen.
2. forbidden password:
   We can restrict the password field should not include common passwords using the validator.
3. Improve code coverage for unit testing and end to end test cases.
4. CI/CD
5. Setup husky and lint-staged to prevent unsafe code push to the repository.
6. Live version.
